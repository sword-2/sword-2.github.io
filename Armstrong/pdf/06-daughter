16:03-18:26 & daughter & Today there are many many people grieving the loss of our dad, Stephen Armstrong. [audio temporarily out] The whole counsel of God's word changed their lives and gave them eyes for eternity. Because of our dad's commitment and dedication to God's calling on his life, many of your lives have been forever changed.

My dad's life was marked by another kind of faithfulness that we want to remember him and honor him today - his faithfulness as our father. Dad didn't just preach the word, he lived it. He taught us about the character of God as our Father by being a father marked by the character of God. In his love for use he was full of patience, he was slow to anger, he was rich in mercy which we often needed and he was generous far beyond our expectations. Our relationship with him was one filled with joy and laughter and a deep trust and security in his love and his provision in our lives. We could not have asked for a better picture of God's love for his children than that of our dad's love for us.

But though the grief we feel is very personal, it is also a shared grief with all of you, because we too feel the incredible heartbreak of loosing our pastor and spiritual leader.
\newline
\newline
Above all else, our dad was faithful in teaching and leading his family in God's word and our lives also will never be the same as a result. A father can pass on many things to his children, but very few people have the privilege of thanking their father for giving them eyes for eternity. Already we miss our dad dearly and grieve his death and yet we do not grieve as those who have no hope.
\newline
\newline
Many people may believe that today we are here to celebrate our dad's life and mourn his death, but that is not true. Today we celebrate our dad's life and we celebrate his death because we know to live is Christ and to die is gain. We cannot thank God enough for the blessing of giving us Stephen Armstrong as a father and we are so excited to see him again soon. We hope that when we see him again he will be as proud of our lives as we are of his. \\
