01:14:55-end & Josh & Pray with me. Honorable and faithful service, Lord we thank you for Steve's honorable and faithful service to you His king, to us his fellow servants. We come with prayers of gratitude and petition of thanks and request. We thank you for Steve's life, for his love, his care for us, his ministry. All are things that You put into his hands to steward and then gave him the diligence and the power and the Spirit to steward them well. And so we thank You. And we come requesting that You would give us the power and the diligence and the spirit to do likewise. Steve was always teaching, always serving as an example, even in his last address in this assembly, calling us forward, to live in such a way as to respond to the gracious good merciful call that You have on us as our King and the living God and so we ask, we request, we petition, that we would walk that way. That would be an honor to him, and most of all, and honor to You. And we ask all of these things and we give you thanks in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
