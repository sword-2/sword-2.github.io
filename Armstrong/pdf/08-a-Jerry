19:25-33:22 & Jerry & Good morning. Thank you Annette and Cat, Daniel for giving me the privilege of honoring Steve today. You know what he meant to me. And with God's help, I'll try to share in 10 minutes some of the achievements and some of my memories of these past 20 years. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jerry Dike and I have known Steve for almost 20 years. He was my best friend, co-laborer, counselor, confidant, pastor, and teacher. Before I tell you more about my friendship with Steve, let me first tell you a little about him and his ministry which most of you, but not all of you already know.

Steve Armstrong was the founder and principle teacher of Verse By Verse Ministry International and the lead pastor of Verse By Verse Fellowship church. Due to the influence of his wife Annette and a good friend pastor Brian Michaels of Colorado Springs, he came to know the Lord in his early 30's while serving as an Air Force officer. After becoming a believer, Steve experienced God's call to learn and teach the bible so in 1997 Steve left the military, found a job in Colorado, and began a self-directed course in study in preparation to teach the scriptures. As he devoted himself to study, Steve developed a love for an in-depth verse by verse style of teaching God's word. Believing it to be the best means to persuade the unbeliever of the truth of the gospel and equip the saints for the work of the ministry.

In 2001, Steve received God's call to move to San Antonio where he soon found opportunities to teach verse by verse in churches throughout the area. It was around that same time that Annette, Catherine, and Daniel joined a home-school group that my wife Kathy and son Jeffrey were a part of and they all became friends quickly.

Despite having no professional religious training, in 2003 Steve was called by God to lead a church planting in the city as pastor of Living Word Fellowship. And at that same time started teaching a bible study on Revelation at a club house in their old neighborhood which Kathy and Jeffrey decided to attend. They would come home all excited about Steve's teaching and I would say - yah, yah, yah. Then I decided to attend one week and came away saying - Whoa. \\
