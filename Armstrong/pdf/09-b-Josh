" & Josh cont'd & Steve said this. The only answer to the question of why the Lord has left you a minute longer than necessary for salvation is that there is some work he intends to use you that advances the gospel in the meantime. That's why you're still here. So the question you have to ask yourself is - are you doing that work? Or are you wasting all this time? To live is Christ, to die is gain, there's no loss in a death coming early for a Christian. But as long as you're alive there's a question waiting. Why am I still here? Everything in your life from now until you die is about serving the needs of the gospel. It's about what you do now with a gospel mentality. If you're a person for whom joy and satisfaction, purpose and meaning are hard to get and hard to keep, may I suggest to you it's because you're living for the wrong goal. Change your goal - change your life.

Some of you remember that very well. Steve had a clarity about that goal, that ended up filling his life with a realization of purpose, filling his life with a realization of meaning and of joy. He saw that goal so clearly, purpose and meaning just kind of oozed out of his life. And he clearly led his family in understanding the clarity of that goal as well. Because if clarity about that goal for a Christian results in a realization of purpose, meaning, and joy, then the fruit of joy is clearly plain to me in Steve's family. I told my wife this week I was just on a conference call with Steve's family. I was on speaker phone and the family was gathered around and Tom was there. And I was helping them prepare for the memorial service and I don't think I have ever done that in a more joyful context. The joy that came from this family that Steve has taught and led and discipled, was clearly the joy of a family that understands the clarity of God's goal for Steve and God's goal for them. It was just clear. There was laughter in the air - sorrow for sure, they grieve not as those without hope, they understand.

Steve's life radiated with the biblical truth that God had purposes for him, that He had prepared good works beforehand, for Steve to walk in them, as Ephesians 2 says. And we all witnessed that didn't we? We all saw the way Steve walked, we could see it. What we couldn't see was how close he was to completing that course, that God had laid out for him, set for him, bounded for him. In his sovereignty marked it out - we didn't see that, Steve didn't see that. That's left in God's hands and God's mind. \\
