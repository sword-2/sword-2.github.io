" & Jerry cont'd & When our family moved as I mentioned, as a 13 year old I really struggled. And it was in the midst of my struggle, that I listened online to a teaching series that Steve did on the sovereignty of God. God used that teaching powerfully in my life to bring me comfort and stability in a way that can only come from confidence in the sovereignty of God. And just so you guys know, Jeffrey had been preparing a sermon that week from Acts 7 about Stephen the first Christian martyr. He goes on to share that. As soon as he hung up the phone he looked up at his screen and realized that seconds before receiving my call he had typed these words - hope in the preservation of Jesus. It then dawned on him that the sovereignty of God he had been preparing a sermon about Jesus receiving the Spirit of Stephen the first Christian martyr. As he received the word about our friend Stephen whose spirit Jesus was faithful to receive that morning.

Yes, God is sovereign. And when we don't understand his plan we continue to trust him. As the Psalmist writes in Psalm 9:10 [verse read]. To Annette, Cat, Mitch, Daniel, Miriam we love you. We're here for you. You can count on this local fellowship, the ministry board, and our partners all over the world to pray for you and continue to build on the legacy that God established through the leadership and teaching of your husband and dad.

And to all of you who are watching and listening online, so we stay focused on the task at hand. Let me leave you with this quote from the last message Steve taught in the gospel of Matthew on Sunday January 3rd, 2021. And I quote, the great commission requires we cultivate a concern for the unsaved for those who don't have what we have in Christ. Going means evangelism. Going beyond the gathering, beyond serving believers, beyond the church doors and to the world. Kingdom work is fundamentally being ambassadors. By teaching we prepare a new generation of disciple makers because eventually new disciples will be stirred by what they learned. Hearts are stirred to go, new disciples are made, more teaching takes place, and the cycle repeats by Christ's authority and power. Set your mind in 2021 on kingdom work. Keep your eyes on eternity, going to the world, welcoming new believers into our body, and teaching them to obey. Thank you. \\
