" & Jerry cont'd & There are countless testimonials from people all over the world who have been influenced by Steve's teaching. Everyone participating in this memorial service, either here at the church with us today or those online could share their own personal story of how God used this man's gift of teaching to change their life. One testimony in particular that I'd like to share is from a young man I know very well, our son, pastor Jeff Dike. This is taken from a message he preached at his church in Stevenvill this past morning. He starts off by saying if you have been redeemed by Jesus, you have committed your soul to a faithful God and you can have full confidence that He who has redeemed you will preserve your soul for all eternity. My confidence in Jesus' promise to preserve their life, the life of their saints, was put to the test this week. I got the word Friday that a long time friend of our family Steven Armstrong died unexpectedly. Steve and his wife Annette are very close friends of our parents and their children Catherine and Daniel grew up together. Steve is a bible teacher and pastor, and I don't think I can overstate just how influential Steve was in my life.

I was 11 or 12 years old when I first sat in a bible study with Steve. It was the first time I had ever heard the bible taught expositionally. He was the first person who modeled for me serious study of the scripture. At the age of 13 after having spent a couple of years in bible studies under Steve's teaching in San Antonio, my family was preparing to move to Jacksonville Florida. And one of the things I was going to miss the most about living in San Antonio was sitting under Steve's teachings. When I told him that he said you don't need me, now you know how to study the bible for yourself. At the time as a 13 year old I thought "yeah, right". But as it turns out, he was right. Those years laid a foundation for me for how to study the bible, not only as a teenager, to this day I'm reaping the fruit of the influence that Steve's teaching had on me in those years. He goes on to say God used Steve Armstrong in my life in many instrumental ways. One way I'm most grateful for is that it was from Steve that I first heard the term the sovereignty of God. \\
