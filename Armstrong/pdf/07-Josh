18:26-19:25 & Josh & Many of you know Jerry Dike. This morning, some of us were remarking that Jerry Dike is kind of like the matchmaker from fiddler on the roof. And he is in fact how I met Steve Armstrong and that may be true of many of you. Jerry has a way of putting people together and I'm thankful to Jerry for many things, but maybe most of all, introducing me to Steve. And uh, Jerry is going to come now and we'd like to hear from him, a little bit from the church's leadership perspective and his personal perspective of the meaningfulness of Stephen's ministry. Come on Jerry. \\
