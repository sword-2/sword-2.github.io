As I said, Steve and I were friends and colleagues and one of the things Steve and I did together was a radio program. Steve and I thought it would be a great idea to have a call in radio program - a talk radio about scripture. And so we recorded a number of episodes of this radio program, and by the number, I mean the number 1. Because we were boring. And here's why - Steve's certainly not boring. And I'm a little more boring than Steve is, but the reason we were boring is because we agreed so much. If you've ever listened to a couple of guys get together and just agree with one another, it makes for really bad radio. So we canceled that idea, and that show, that spot on the radio, became a spot that was just dedicated to Steve's bible teaching.

And that is what it should have been, and was. That is what it was meant to do because that was Steve's passion when it came to communicating was opening up God's word and communicating verse by verse the truth of God's word. And he was so gifted at that and that's what that radio program became and that's what this church knows and what you who are listening online have tuned into this ministry for so long its what you know and love about Steve and he just had a way, a confident way of communicating God's word. He had the kind of confidence you got to borrow. You know what I mean? Its one of the things that made him such a great leader - he had confidence to borrow.

I showed a clip of Steve's teaching to my teenagers, my 2 oldest. I showed them the clip of the last sermon that Steve preached. As he preached one of the central truths in the letter to the Philippians, about the central meaning of the life of the Christian. The purpose and meaning and central joy of the Christ follower. And as they listened to that quote from that sermon, that clip, understanding already that Steve had passed, they were just stunned, and flabbergasted, and tearful. Not just because of loss but tearful because they recognized that God was doing something special in what Steve was uttering that morning, just 11, 13 days ago. I'm going to read to you a short portion of that sermon. Listen to this. \\
