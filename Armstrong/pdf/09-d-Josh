" & Josh cont'd & That we would live lives responding to this news. That the living God, the sovereign king of the universe is reconciling you to himself through Jesus Christ. That you can live in joyful allegiance to the rightful King. And you can only do that because you have been united to Christ Jesus in faith. And that you, in all of your rebellion and treachery against the living God can be completely forgiven by his grace because every ounce of punishment and judgment that would be right for a rebel against the King to receive, has been taken by Jesus. So that you can come confidently to him understanding mercy is for me and life. And not only that, a life full of purpose, and meaning, and joy. He's prepared good works for you to walk in. You have a whole life, you don't know how long it is, but you have a whole life marked out for you, where you get to live in joyful allegiance - not to yourself anymore, but to the King.

That is the appeal that God is making through His word to you. That is the appeal God is making through my voice right now. Live your whole life in response to the opportunity for joyful allegiance and mercy, that is the appeal God made every time we heard from Steve Armstrong, wasn't it? Would you pray with me: Lord God, would you grant us strength and wisdom, diligence, discernment to live in response to that truth. Lord if this is a truth that we have rejected heretofore, if everything up until now has been nothing but rebellion from us Lord, would you by the Spirit of God break through and draw us to you in submission and humility crying out for grace. Lord, if we are listening right now and we know this truth, would you still grant us the ability to live in response to it. You're not done with us yet, why are we still here? We're still here to continue to respond to your grace. Lord, would you open our eyes that we might see that more clearly, and live as Steve lived, walking in response to your gospel. We ask for these things in Jesus name. Amen.
