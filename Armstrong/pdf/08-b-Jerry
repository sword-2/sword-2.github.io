" & Jerry cont'd & It was clear that Steve had a gift and he and I quickly became good friends. Despite having no professional religious training, in 2003, Steve was called by God to lead a church planting effort in the city as pastoring living word, as I've said. That same year Steve founded Verse By Verse Ministry of San Antonio, later to be renamed Verse By Verse Ministry International. Out of a desire to offer his unique style of in-depth bible teaching for free to a world wide audience via the internet. Today Verse By Verse Ministries worldwide reach in a substantial catalog and insightful bible teaching is proof that the Lord calls unqualified men and women, but won't leave them untrained.

The next year 2004, our family moved to Florida and struggled with that decision for 6 months until we found a really good bible church that taught verse by verse. It was during our 8 years in Florida that I became closer to Steve, constantly seeking feedback on teaching I was doing in a Sunday School class attended by mature bible students. Steve and I had regular phone conversations and email exchanges and our families would get together over the years in both Texas and Florida. And our friendship continued to grow.

During the early years of Verse by Verse ministries, Steve taught a bible study at USAA every Monday at noon. Another at Wayside chapel every Wednesday night, and in 2007 he was asked to fill the pulpit at a bible church in southwest Austin. And for 10 years, Steve and Annette would leave early every Sunday morning and drive the 90 miles for those international listeners, a 150 km [drive]. They would drive that one way to serve that local church.

When our family moved back to San Antonio in 2012, Steve asked me to join the board of directors of verse by verse ministry. I felt inadequate to serve in that capacity and I told Steve so. To which he said, that's one of the reasons I want you on the board. Always affirming, always seeing the best in people. In 2017, Steve agreed with the ministry board that pastoring the church long distance in south Austin was untenable and agreed to quit his job at USAA and plant a church in San Antonio. So after months of planning on January 25th 2018, Verse by Verse Fellowship had its first church service on a Thursday night in a small church on Redland Rd, that had graciously offered to us to use their facility. We quickly outgrew that space and over the next several months as we looked for a new location, God connected us to Jim Rolan and other leaders at Oak Hills church, who ultimately helped us gain access to the building we now occupy. \\
