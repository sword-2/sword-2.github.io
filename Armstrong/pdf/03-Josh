08:15-11:03 & Josh De Koning & Lord God, Father, would you receive our gratitude and thanks in the way in which you used Steve to minister into our lives in so many different ways. Gathered here this morning and gathered online listening and watching a multitude of different ministries and moments of interaction that by your Spirit you have used your servant Steve to advance your truth and love. And so we give you thanks this morning for him and his life and his ministry and his service in the fullest sense of the word. Thank you.

And we also ask that You would comfort us. Would You comfort us in the way only You can. Though You may use many other servants as part of that, would You comfort us? Because now we're without him. And we know You have always been the source, and because You are the source, You will choose the means by which You comfort, hold and love us. Lord, we were really attached to Steve as a means of Your love in our lives. So we require comfort. And when Your people require comfort you [unintelligible]. come asking boldly, confidently, but truly needy. Would You grant that to us in Jesus name, we ask. Amen.

Good morning, my name is Josh De Koning, I'm the senior pastor at crossway bible church just a little bit down the road and Steve and I were good friends and colleagues and we spent a lot of time on the phone together discussing how to lead churches and really enjoyed doing that and learning from one another. So it is absolutely my privilege and honor to be here this morning to lead this service. So I'm going to ask at this point for Bob Butler to come and open us with exactly what Steve would want and that is the reading of holy scripture. \\
