" & Josh cont'd & We don't know the fullness of God's sovereign plan. But that makes me think of the precise meaning of Psalm 116 verse 15. That's my text that I've been meditating on in regards to Steve all week long. Psalm 116:15, you're probably already familiar with. That verse says Precious in the eyes of the Lord are the death of his saints. Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints. What does that mean? You know Steve would never let me get away with not explaining exactly what that means. He would want me to goto the original languages, which I have. He would want me to goto the context, right? Steve would always walk you through the context right? Well here's the context of Psalm 116.

Psalm 116 is not about one of God's people dying. Psalm 116 is about one of God's people being preserved. Psalm 116 is about one of God's people not dying. What Psalm 116:15 - Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints - what that means is not precious as in adorable, that God is just feeling warm and fuzzy, about the death of his saints. Its not precious as in adorable. Clearly the context doesn't mean that. What the context shows us is the word precious means costly, purposeful, dear. That God does not take his people home carelessly. As you might spend something that is precious and dear to you, you do it with intentionality and purpose. Dear, intentional, purposeful is the death of his saints. So its easy for us to ask - how can that be? How could God have been so intentional and so purposeful in the death of Steve Armstrong? And that's because we can imagine sermons that Steve would still preach. We can imagine moments that we would still have with Steve. We can imagine more opportunities for God to use Steve in sharing His good news.

How could God have been intentional and purposeful in Steve's death? But if we hold that question with humility for just a little while, it begins to rotate. God rotates that question, if we'll hold it humbly. And we realize that really the question isn't from us to Him, what are your purposes in Steve's death? The question is from Him to us. What are His purposes in your life? As Steve would say, why are you still here?

And the answer is embedded in the last sermon that Steve preached. The answer is embedded in the central truth of the letter to the Philippians, that our lives are lived as gospel responses. That the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead. Pressing on towards the goal for prize of the upward call of Christ Jesus. That's why you're still here. And its with those intentions and purposes that God has given you life and its with God's sovereign intentions and purposes that he has marked Steve's course to be just so. \\
