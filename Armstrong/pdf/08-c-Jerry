" & Jerry cont'd & Both the online ministry and the local fellowship have continued to thrive over these past 3 years as more and more people hungry for the deep teaching of scripture have been connecting with both ministries. In fact, our latest metrics for both the web site and mobile app shows that 10,000 people a day worldwide are logging in for a bible study or other information. And verse by verse fellowship has estimated 600 regular or semi-regular attenders. Now let me tell you my thoughts about Steve Armstrong, the man. We all know that Steve loved God with all his heart and loved studying and teaching scripture. He was a fast learner, retained tons of knowledge, and was quick on his feet. I think we all loved his Q and A sessions.

Steve also loved traveling, exploring, he loved guns - he had lots and lots of guns. Technology - he had a lot of that stuff too. Music, photography, he loved stupid jokes. And in spite of what he might say, he loved poodles. Steve had a quick wit and many of the texts he and I shared were silly back and forth fool-hearty kidding. Ridiculous really. It was hard to outwit Steve, but one of my favorites was telling Steve that when I couldn't sleep at night, I would listen to one of his sermons. That would usually do the trick.

Above all else, Steve loved his family. He was devoted to Annette and always treated her with respect in public and in private. He loved his kids and was so proud of their accomplishments, and he loved their spouses as his own children. Steve was always teaching his kids and they loved learning from him. I'll never forget one night Steve and I were sitting out on their back patio discussing life and ministry when Daniel came out to ask a what if question that didn't seem to be all that important or have any biblical solution. So I asked Steve, does it really matter? And Steve said I never discourage scholarship with my kids no matter what the question might be.
