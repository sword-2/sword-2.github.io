## Why the project is useful? 

personal use. One individual was trying to code an open source project. 

## Comments

Nothing represents The [SWORD project](https://crosswire.org/svn/sword/trunk). The individual making the page is only attempting pieces of code and is not capable of a whole functioning app.

Many times, but not always, code was adapted from other's posts.

Personal notes on making documents ...
