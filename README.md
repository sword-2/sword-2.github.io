## Comments

The repo's are just personal notes. Nothing represents The [SWORD project](https://crosswire.org/svn/sword/trunk). The programming skills and abilities of past and current SWORD programmers exceed this repo. Also, the pastor was not consulted to verify everything is correct.

Many times, but not always, code was adapted from posts other's had on the internet whether a blog, stackoverflow, Apple forum, etc. Attempts to start some documents included ...

Software documentation. doxygen had been run for C/C++ but not yet successfully for swift. Maybe the swift keywords were different than C/C++ and something happened? swift-docc example code was run to experiment if it will load to github pages.
- doxygen [link](https://sword-2.github.io/html/html/index.html).
- swift-docc attempt [link](https://sword-2.github.io/docc/rpt/i2.html)


- incomplete draft of [requirements](https://sword-2.github.io/requirements/1a_des/o_des_rel.html).

## Limitations

Perceived limitations follows ...
- [Memory safety concern and investigation for C/C++](https://sword-2.github.io/added-html/cpp_segv_handler/index.html).
- [swift document compiler (docc)](https://sword-2.github.io/added-html/swift/docc.html).
