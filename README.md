## Comments

The repo's are just personal notes. Nothing represents The [SWORD project](https://crosswire.org/svn/sword/trunk). The programming skills and abilities of past and current SWORD programmers exceed this repo. Also, the pastor was not consulted to verify everything is correct.

Many times, but not always, code was adapted from posts other's had on the internet whether a blog, stackoverflow, Apple forum, etc. Usually code was modified a little or combined with other code scraps from another blog. Attempts to start some documents included ...

- doxygen [link](https://sword-2.github.io/html/html/index.html).
- docc [link](https://sword-2.github.io/docc/rpt/index.html)
- incomplete draft of [requirements](https://sword-2.github.io/requirements/1a_des/o_des_rel.html).

## Limitations

Perceived limitations follows ...
- [Memory safety concern and investigation for C/C++](https://sword-2.github.io/added-html/cpp_segv_handler/index.html).
- [swift document compiler (docc)](https://sword-2.github.io/added-html/swift/docc.html).
