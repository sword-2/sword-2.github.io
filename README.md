## Comments

Nothing represents The [SWORD project](https://crosswire.org/svn/sword/trunk). The programming skills and abilities of past and current SWORD programmers exceed this repo. Also, the pastor was not consulted to verify content.

Many times, but not always, code was adapted from other's posts. Also, personal notes means more errors/typos, since nothing was checked with church staff.

Attempts to start some documents included ...

- doxygen [link](https://sword-2.github.io/html/html/index.html).
- swift-docc [link](https://sword-2.github.io/swift/documentation/diatheke)

## Perceived Limitations

- [Memory safety concern and investigation for C/C++](https://sword-2.github.io/added-html/cpp_segv_handler/index.html).
- [swift document compiler (docc)](https://sword-2.github.io/added-html/swift/docc.html).
