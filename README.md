## Comments

Nothing represents The [SWORD project](https://crosswire.org/svn/sword/trunk). The programming skills and abilities of past and current SWORD programmers exceed this repo. Also, the pastor was not consulted to verify content.

Many times, but not always, code was adapted from other's posts. 

Attempts to start some documents included ...

- doxygen [link](https://sword-2.github.io/html/html/index.html).
- swift-docc [link](https://sword-2.github.io/swift/documentation/diatheke)
- incomplete draft of [requirements](https://sword-2.github.io/requirements/1a_des/o_des_rel.html).

## Perceived Limitations

- [Memory safety concern and investigation for C/C++](https://sword-2.github.io/added-html/cpp_segv_handler/index.html).
- [swift document compiler (docc)](https://sword-2.github.io/added-html/swift/docc.html).
