<title>Comments to CAD handbook</title>
</head><body>

<p>Optional comments to CAD handbook. Optional due to partially intersecting motive of building CAD.</p>


<h2>1.0 Scope</h2>

<p>The scope clearly said the handbook was for the DOD community. Does the handbook have partial intent to use common definitions with non-DOD community? If not, those outside of DOD might expect unique terminology / lingo, and maybe less likely to read.</p>


<p>Does the scope allow preparing replies to recommendations observed in Gov Accountability Office (GAO)'s <a href="https://files.gao.gov/reports/GAO-25-108528/index.html?_gl=1*myc7e2*_ga*MTE4NTE0ODMxMi4xNzQwNTEyNTI0*_ga_V393SNS3SR*czE3NTA1MTM4NDQkbzMwJGcxJHQxNzUwNTEzOTYwJGo1JGwwJGgw#TOC_3">DEFENSE ACQUISITION REFORM: Persistent Challenges Require New Iterative Approaches to Delivering Capability with Speed</a>? The question / comment does not intend to increase burden having learned others were hurt by more burden like in Exodus 5:9-11. Instead, the GAO document may provide opportunity to copy diagrams, consider categories of information as part of normal writing.</p>

<!--
<p>A job outlook for drafters predicted slight reduction in <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/drafters.htm">Drafters : Occupational Outlook Handbook: : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a>. The GAO report seemed to indicate at leaset a little more burden to drafters if their speed will be increasing?</p>
-->

<h2>2.2 Government Documents</h2>


<p>Does your handbook have any similar structure in meta-data, body content, appendices, etc compared to <a href="https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Publication-Notices/Article/3847472/aec-computer-aided-design-cad-standard-release-62/">US Army Engineer Research and Development Center A/E/C Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Standard: Release 6.2</a>. I could not comment to encourage one writing guide as there are multiple inside and outside of defense. Potential efficiency when one answer is possible for a section, chapter, appendix.</p>

<h2>4 General guidance, 4.1  MBE overview.</h2>


<p>Is the Model-based Enterprise (MBE) structure a term only for the DOD community? Other models that look like a different general structure were observed, such as listed below.<p>

<p>Four principles in GAO's <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106222.pdf">LEADING PRACTICES Iterative Cycles Enable Rapid Delivery of Complex, Innovative Products</a>, where detail was only added for principle 2:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Principle 1 Attain sound business case</li>
	<li>Principle 2 Use an iterative design approach that results in minimum viable products (MVP)
		<br>Leading companies use modern design tools, such as digital engineering and additive manufacturing, throughout development for both hardware and software. Key concepts within this sub-principle related to this report include: 
		<ul>
			<li>The use of iterative design and testing allows leading companies to identify an MVP—a product with the minimum capabilities needed for customers to recognize value and that can be followed by successive updates.</li>
			<li>Digital engineering includes digital twins—virtual representations of physical products. Digital twins incorporate dynamic data of a physical object or a system—meaning the model changes and updates in real-time as new information becomes available. Unlike a digital twin, a 3D model is a static visualization of a physical aspect—meaning it cannot be updated without someone manually inputting new data, and is similar to paper design drawings in digital form. Digital threads are a common source of information that connect stakeholders with real-time data across the product life cycle.</li>
			<li>3D printing is a type of additive manufacturing, a computer-controlled process that creates physical objects, such as aircraft components, by depositing materials, usually in layers.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Principle 3 Prioritize schedule by off-ramping capabilities when necessary.</li>
	<li>Principle 4 Collect user feedback to inform improvements to the minimum viable product.</li>
</ul>


<p>A general model structure for CAD was observed in a past training series titled <i>Machine Tool Advanced Skills Technology (MAST)</i>. This was considered a general model as CAD was nested into a single volume, volume 10 as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED401431.pdf">Volume 1</a>
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MACHINE TOOL ADVANCED SKILLS TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROJECT GOALS AND DELIVERABLES
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROJECT METHODOLOGY
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROJECT CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPENDICES
	</li>
	<li>Volume 2 CAREER DEVELOPMENT GENERAL EDUCATION REMEDIATION</li>
	<li>Volume 3 MACHINING - CORE COURSES (MAC)</li>
	<li>Volume 4 MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY (MET)</li>
	<li>Volume 5 MOLD MAKING (MLD)</li>
	<li>Volume 6 WELDING (WLD)</li>
	<li>Volume 7  INDUSTRIAL MAINTENANCE (IMM)</li>
	<li>Volume 8  SHEET METAL (SML) AND COMPOSITES (COM)</li>
	<li>Volume 9  TOOL AND DIE (TLD)</li>
	<li>Volume 10  COMPUTER-AIDED DRAFTING AND DESIGN (CAD)</li>
	<li>Volume 11  COMPUTER-AIDED MANUFACTURING AND ADVANCED CNC (CNC)</li>
	<li>Volume 12  INSTRUMENTATION (INT)</li>
	<li>Volume 13 LASER MACHINING (LSR)</li>
	<li>Volume 14 AUTOMATED EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGY (CIM)</li>
	<li>Volume 15 ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>Those MAST volumes might identify a chance to feedback in a GAO recommendation that there is more than just 3D printing listed previously in principle 2. Or else a chance to remove expired records on methods, if it is allowed to work outside of the DoD community.</p>
-->



<h2>3.0 Acronyms and Definitions</h2>
<p>Minimum viable product (MVP) abbreviation was observed in GAO's principle 2, but not observed in handbook section 3.0. This goes back to the scope definition of what is the DOD community.</p>

<h2>6.5 Modeling tools</h2>

<p>Is it possible to hand-off the tool recommendations substantially to a technology organization, Chief Information Officer (CIO), or designee? I was sad to perceive that the amount of trouble in software and technology exceeds reasonable effort by the handbook authors. The handbook section seems to hand off burden to another contractor or agency saying <i>Every effort should be made to conduct an exhaustive review of vendors and the digital modeling tools they offer ...</i>. Does this force a contractor to have a high level of expertise, since the burden is just being transferred? Experts are great, but we are all limited. Evidence that software trouble exceeds handbook scope includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the BRL-CAD modeling tool mentioned in the<a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/">DOD Open Source Software FAQ</a> was not observed in handbook section 6.5.</li>
	<li>Several technology and computer standards organizations were not observed in the handbook's referenced documents in the present time of reported IT troubles.</li>
	<li>Trouble goes below the application level (CAD) to software languages according to NSA's <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/16/2003629074/-1/-1/0/Joint-Guide-Closing-the-Software-Understanding-Gap.PDF">Closing the Software Understanding Gap</a>.</li>
	<li>Package managers for operating systems may not have assessed, selected, and prepared the easiest CAD tools for users to install. This based on spot check of the <i>dnf</i> package manager when searching for a CAD tool in Windows WSL2 - OracleLinux8.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tables below are not for handbook comments, but a list a few more tools found outside of DOD community when considering modeling for buildings. Any inconsistencies between the programs might be evidence of further software trouble.</p>

<h2>6.7  DoD physical modeling and standards.</h2>

<p>Is any training appropriate using civil CAD data files? Maybe one has to be trained first before showing up. If training is allowed, re-use of a file outside of DoD community might demonstrate a type of efficiency, to claim progress on GAO's <i>Principle 1 Attain sound business case</i>. Of course, being a defense handbook it will eventually do an unmanned system. But before that, civil file options observed were put to the table below, most from State and City transportation agencies.</p>

<p>Generic loss inside and outside of the DoD community was observed in the NIST article <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/02/inadequate-modeling-data-costs-billions-us-manufacturers">Inadequate Modeling Data Costs Billions to US Manufacturers</a>. This just looked like extra content to consider or copy as part encouraging attainment of a sound business case.</p>

	<td>3.1.44 Technical data CAD format:

		<br><br>3.1.44.1 Native CAD data.  CAD data as created in its original authoring software using that software's data format.  In general, only the original authoring software is capable of reading, editing and interpreting native CAD data.  (Examples: CREO, CATIA, NX, Autodesk, SolidWorks, etc.)  Generally native CAD data is the format suitable to serve as master technical data.  Native CAD data may also serve as authoritative technical data.


		<br><br>3.1.44.2 Neutral CAD data. CAD data which is derived from the native format and converted into a format which can be imported into other software (e.g., for purposes of acquisition, design, fabrication, analysis maintenance, etc.).  Neutral CAD data is created to a widely available national or international standard (e.g. STEP, IPC 2581).  In general, neutral CAD data as derivative technical data is not suited to serve as master technical data but may serve as either reference or authoritative technical data.

		<br><br>3.1.44.3 Viewable CAD data.  CAD data which is derived from the native format and converted into a format which can be displayed by a widely available software and for purposes of defining design intent in a human readable format (e.g. 3Di PDF).  In general, viewable CAD data cannot serve as master technical data but may serve as either reference or authoritative technical data.

		<br><br>6.5  Modeling tools.  There are several digital modeling tools available today.  These tools provide a collaborative platform for research, design, development, and verification methods that improve cost, schedule, and performance of the acquisition item.  Every effort should be made to conduct an exhaustive review of vendors and the digital modeling tools they offer, which will support selecting the tool that best meets the programs need.  These tools also form the basis to support more efficient sustainment and modification of acquisition items that are addressed in other chapters of this handbook.  It is recommended to use an order of preference with tool selection. Some tools can share data better than others.  A preferred list of tools will minimize the proliferation of tools and provide simple, more efficient translation of data.  Tools based on different standards or design criteria will make translated data files larger and result in a greater loss of data fidelity.  A sample order of preference is shown in Appendix B.  Before establishing an order of preference, the Government will verify that it has acquired the appropriate seat and site license to those tools under another contract so that the Government will be able to view, using its IT infrastructure, the models the contractor will develop and deliver via the TDP CDRL.
