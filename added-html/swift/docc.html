<h1>Swift document compiler (docc)</h1>

<p>Draft content was loaded to github and not checked on local device. The docc output file (index.html) was observed to require operation of JavaScript. Although JavaScript was great for many browsers environments, it wasn't currently good for one terminal environment with terminal browsers like w3m and elinks. Thus, it wasn't checked with w3m, elinks, etc.</p>

<p>Doxygen content was able to be checked on the local device with terminal browsers. It allowed the JavaScript to be turned off by configuring the HTML_DYNAMIC_MENUS tag. An equivalent configuration was not yet known for swift-docc.</p>
