<h1>Swift document compiler (docc)</h1>

<p>swift-docc content was loaded to github and not first checked on local device. The docc output file (index.html) was observed to require operation of JavaScript which the current terminal environment with terminal browsers like w3m and elinks doesn't do.</p>

<p>Doxygen reports for C/C++ etc were able to be checked on the local device with the terminal browsers (w3m / elinks). doxygen allowed most of the JavaScript to be turned off by configuring the HTML_DYNAMIC_MENUS tag. An equivalent configuration was not yet learned for swift-docc.</p>
