<h1>Swift document compiler (docc)</h1>

<p>The docc output file (index.html) was observed to require operation of JavaScript. JavaScript was great for many user environments, but wasn't for one terminal software development environment since terminal browsers like w3m and elinks didn't like JavaScript. doxygen had been able to turn off javascript by configuring the HTML_DYNAMIC_MENUS tag. An equivalent was not yet known for swift-docc.
</p>

<p>One possible workaround for the terminal browsers was to load the swift-docc output to github pages where a more common browser would be capable of running the javascript.</p>
