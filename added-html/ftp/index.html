<h1>file transfer protocol (ftp) server</h1>

<p>SWORD customers could load study aids with the SWORD module repositories (libraries), and this used the file transfer protocol (ftp), according to reference 1.</p>

<p>According to reference 2, github didn't do ftp.</p>

<p>To use a FTP server, open source ftp services were searched for. A few trials is all that may be necessary to succeed.</p> 

<p>A first advertised ftp provider was found in reference 3. An account was made with the provider, and an Android app was installed to operate the service. However, use of this provider was paused after attempting to publish a SWORD tutorial module and getting the following message:
<br>Folders and websites published by Free Accounts are good for preview only and will expire in 20 minutes. To avoid the expiration, please upgrade to True or Paid account.
<br>
Apparently, one is a True member if they have a corporate email address. The account had been signed up for using a basic gmail.com, which apparently was not accepted as a true email.</p>
