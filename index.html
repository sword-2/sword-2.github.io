<h2>Files for feedback Hub</h2>

<p>It might not be fair to involve Microsoft in messy HTML code. The report was because the first symptom of trouble was the translation in Edge. Ran the file UI.html thru the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">Nu HTML Checker</a> and reduced the response to one warning: Warning: Text run is not in Unicode Normalization Form C.</p>

<p>The file UI.html appears different when opened locally in WSL2/Edge compared to when opened from github/Edge. In WSL2, the Hebrew looks as described in the original feedbackHub report like some unknown language. But the same file opened from the net looks like it might be the intended Hebrew. Another unexpected thing was the file UI_min.html, which removed almost all html except the Hebrew, looked like the Hebrew in WSL2.</p>
