<h2>Files to support feedback Hub</h2>

<p>It might not be fair to involve Microsoft in messy HTML code present in the feedbackHub folder. So the issue may just be identifying how to protect Edge from perceived anomaly. Ran the file UI.html thru the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">Nu HTML Checker</a> and changed it to reduce the response to one item Warning: Text run is not in Unicode Normalization Form C.</p>

<p>The file UI.html was observed to display different when opened locally in WSL2/Edge compared to when opened from github/Edge. In WSL2, the Hebrew looks changed as described in the original feedbackHub report, like some foreign language. But the same file opened from the net looks like it might be the intended Hebrew. Another unexpected thing was the file UI_min.html, which removed almost all html except the Hebrew, displayed different than UI.html locally. It looks like the intended Hebrew.</p>
