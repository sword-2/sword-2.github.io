Stuff waiting for a move.

Diagram verses for long verses like Colossians 1.

<p>Because devices can have their own unique user interfaces for software, different "front ends" are expected. Such front-ends can install using methods the operator may have learned in their market using other apps.</p>

On bishop, some things were not obvious.
	--uncertain how to run install manager to get modules (commentary). The 'library' menu item looked similar to 'install manager' on the SWORD engine. When selecting the modules pick list, a bunch of 'radio buttons' for installation sources appeared, and it wasn't clear which source to select for commentary.
		Bible.org
		CrossWire
		CrossWire Attic
		CrossWire Beta
		CrossWire Wycliffe
		Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft
		IBT
		Lockman Foundation
		Xiphos
		eBible.org
		Advanced Installation Options
	--didn't know what the variant graph is. Unknown acronyms like 'ECM'?
	--took a while to connect the highlighted verse to the menu item for verse study.

Software/computer practices:
	Where are the repos for install manager? Can an operator upload a commentary to repo then from repo to app?

Extracted from reference materials: The goal also includes module activities and checking on permissions from copyright holders.

Worship songs-independent list; and when applying to a verse.

Video sermons-for chapters of bible.

Appendices: maps, index

Study aids: Granville-sharp rule. Pat taught about it. It can relate some passages.

sw/computer donations process: 
		There are several practices, including minimizing redundancy. Redundant programs for the bible might indicate a new capability, but also could be a division, or one developer did not know about another when generating code. Matthew 9:37 reported the harvest was plentiful, but laborers few. When there are fewer laborers, there is less burden by minimizing the redundancy. Table 1c identifies some scriptures about divisions in other contexts other that software, many of which would discourage division. </tr>

Goal for aids: Reference materials include dictionaries, commentaries, etc. 

Goal 4:
		Open source procedure
		The bible's concept to reach others is closer to open source that a copyright to just a small group. Also, an open source program is more accepting of people of faith - people who might be predicted to have interest in maintaining scriptures.</td>

		<td>Minimize pitfalls</td>
		<td>There are several pitfalls. One pitfall is splitting the little manpower interested in bible software across too many disconnected open source projects. Too many split projects may cause perception of messier workmanship. Another pitfall is having excessive complexity. Too much complexity could turn people away from the project, even resulting in starting another program, or just not using anything.</td>

checking on permissions for modules.
