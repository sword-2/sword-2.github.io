<p>This page has some comments about 
<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB495">Assembly Bill 495.</a><p>

<h2 id="pu">Family institution's ability to pickup their child</h2>
<p>Will parents who are already present and adequately raising their child be at risk of an unexpected person picking up their child? A parent could become anxious if they though their child was missing, even for a short while.</p>


<p class="two">No family code summary was observed in the <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Index?transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29">California Code of Regulations (CCR)</a> so a diagram was put below to fill in the perceived gap. Family was one of three institutions on earth along with Government and church according to the diagram. Each of the institutions ideally has its leader. The family institution's leader might not want to be disassembled, just like the other institutions do not want any dis-assembly.</p>

<p>The diagram was reconstructed from a <a href="https://www.faithtoyou.com/daniel-32830">video sermon</a> at time 00:22:00. The symbols identifying each institution were church - key, Government - sword, family - rod. Scriptures for those symbols were copied to table 1.</p>

<h2 id="existing">Existing codes</h2>

<p>The legislative family code already had <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?tocCode=FAM&division=8.&title=&part=&chapter=&article=&nodetreepath=10">division 8 for custody of children</a>. Is this a logical place for definitions of relative? If pieces of definitions are scattered across all codes that might not optimally <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/organize/">Organize the information.</a> Section <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&division=8.&title=&part=1.&chapter=2.&article=">3012.(a)</a> in division 8 already started codes for child custody proceedings in an Immigration situation.</p>

Would local child support services have a harder time reporting if the definition of relative becomes more ambiguous or the code modifies the family institution?</p>

<h2 id="pw">Plain writing act</h2>

<p>Are any other States planning a similar bill? Minimizing <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/design/minimize-cross-references/">cross-references</a> was encouraged for plain writing, and more consistent verbiage could prevent a lengthy table of cross-references to try and follow each unique bill, if that will occur.</p>


<h2 id="efficiency">Judicial efficiency</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://courts.ca.gov/policy-administration/judicial-council/judicial-branch-strategic-plan">Mission of the Judiciary</a> included the word efficiency:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judiciary will-in a fair, accessible, effective, and <b>efficient</b> manner—resolve disputes arising under the law and will interpret and apply the law consistently, impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United States.</p>

<p>A review might check procedures like 234.7(f)(1) on <i>limiting assistance with immigration enforcement at public schools, to the fullest extent possible ...</i> to see if they are the most efficient. The judicial web page advertised an <a href="https://courts.ca.gov/policy-administration/invitations-comment">ITC (Invitation to Comment)</a> but AB495 was not observed.</p>

<p>If a immigrant parent was going back to their home country, the home countries rules would not be the California Constitution. However, one of the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&division=&title=&part=&chapter=&article=I">ARTICLE I DECLARATION OF RIGHTS</a> was SEC. 31. which prohibited discrimination by national origin in education. If the home country wanted to keep the parent and child together, would the child be discriminated against by preventing that process of their natural origin?</p>
