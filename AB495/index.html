<p>This page has some comments about 
<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB495">Assembly Bill 495.</a><p>

<h2 id="pu">Family institution's ability to pickup their child</h2>
<p>Will parents who are already present and adequately raising their child be at risk of an unexpected person picking up their child?</p>


<p class="two">Family was one of three institutions on earth along with Government and church according to the diagram below. Each of the institutions ideally has its leader. Would the bill dismantle the leader for a present family institution adequately taking care of their child?</p>

The diagram was reconstructed from a <a href="https://www.faithtoyou.com/daniel-32830">video sermon</a> at time 00:22:00. The symbol identifying the church institution was a key, Government was a sword, and family a rod. Scriptures for the diagram were copied to table 1.</p>

<p>No family code summary was observed in the <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Index?transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29">California Code of Regulations (CCR)</a> so the diagram seemed suitable to fill in. Family code did exist in the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml">legislative codes</a>, just not observed in the CCR.</p>

<h2 id="existing">Existing codes</h2>
By the code hierarchy in table 2, article 5.7 indicated the bill could respond to immigration situations. If a immigrant parent was going back to their home country, would California want to check if there was a family rule back in the home country? Assuming some home countries would want the child to stay with his/her parent, is that a good way to help the child receive care?

<p>The legislative family code already had division 8 for custody of children. If custody is under discussion, is this a good place for it? Section <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&division=8.&title=&part=1.&chapter=2.&article=">3012. (a)</a> already started codes for child custody proceedings in an Immigration situation.</p>

<h2 id="localChildServices">Local Child Services</h2>
<p>Would local child support services have a harder time reporting? <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Document/I221532E85B6211EC9451000D3A7C4BC3?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)">22 CCR 121120 State Performance Measures</a> had a report for (7) Percent of children for whom paternity has been established. Is it more confusing who the parent is if the custody rules are changed, or family institution modified?</p>

<h2 id="pw">Plain writing act</h2>

<p>Are any other States planning a similar bill? Minimizing <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/design/minimize-cross-references/">cross-references</a> was encouraged for plain writing, and more consistent verbiage could prevent a lengthy table of cross-references to try and follow each unique bill, if that will occur.</p>
